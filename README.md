Synopsis
========
The project is an embedded software system for robotic arm control. It was completed by myself and my project partner, William Hunt.

Motivation
========
The project was developed as a final project for the "Unified Robotics III" class. 

Implementation and re-use
========
The system runs on MSP430. The robotic arm is supposed to have 4 servos installed as it is shown on the video. The system should be used mostly as a reference because it might be difficult to re-create the board used for the project.
